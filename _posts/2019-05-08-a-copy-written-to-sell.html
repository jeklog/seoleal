<p>Writing a copy is not a very hard thing. Anyone who has a good knowledge of English can do and drive SEO traffic to
    your website. But writing a good copy that sells comes with experience and needs a lot of trial and error. In
    today's post, we will talk about the decision making the power of the subconscious mind and why most of the
    decisions are made there.</p>

<p>According to Anik, who has been voted as one of the Top 3 Young Entrepreneurs by BusinessWeek Magazine says in one of
    the sessions that subconscious mind is the place where all decisions are made whereas conscious mind is the place
    which is used to justify those decisions. And I tend to agree with him on this point.</p>

<h2>Example 1:</h2>

<p>If you have an emotional connection with a product, in my case it would be real estate, you tend to make out a way
    for it when the prices drop. Let's say there is a very beautiful piece of real estate that you want to buy but you
    are unable to justify the decision looking at the cost of it. But let's say someone come up to and tells that there
    is some discount going on at that place. Maybe the owner wants to sell it quickly.</p>

<p>Your conscious mind starts justifying why taking the deal is a good reason.</p>

<p><strong>Good Investment opportunity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good Resale value</strong></p>

<p>Although, you are not able to justify the cost, but still due to emotional connection, we end up spending the money
    on that product.</p>

<h2>Spend 90% on the subconscious and 10% on conscious</h2>

<p>
    <blockquote>Great copywriters spend 90 percent of the time on making subconscious experiences which 10 percent of
        the
        time on conscious experiences.</blockquote>
</p>

<p>It is a good practice to interrupt the user before they start using their conscious brain.</p>

<h2>Example 2:</h2>

<p><strong>Why would a person want to lose weight?</strong></p>

<p>Not because they will feel better. Not because they will not feel tired all the time. Not because it will cure their
    back pain.</p>

<p><strong>They will want to lose weight so that they can look good.</strong></p>

<p>This is the main reason why I started this blog in the first place. I wanted to gain financial freedom. I want to
    help more people in gaining the financial freedom that I have. I don't want to stick to a single source of income.
</p>

<p><strong>Public Speaking,</strong> is another such example. People keep on saying that they need to improve in public
    speaking but very few people try to do it.</p>

<p>Most people enter the business with thinking that they want to sell OK. But they don't know even if to sell OK,
    they need to know the advanced topics in the field.</p>

<p>I have been working in the tech field for a good time now. Most of the hard problems we solved subconsciously when
    we are not thinking about them.</p>

<p>Anytime you sit down to write something, keep these tactics in mind.</p>

<p>When you write something don't give the answers to what, give the answers why. This tactic will take you to a long
    distance in copywriting or SEO business. You have to make the customer believe that your earlier customers have been
    in their position before. But after using the product that you are selling there life has overturned.</p>

<p>When your customer feels the emotional connection between them and your earlier customer they tend to take the
    decision using their subconscious mind which will some or the other way benefit you and help you to reach that small
    goal of yours.</p>
