<p>Now let's take a ride toward the questions that could appear in your first interview.</p>

<h4>What is SEO & why it is important?</h4>

<p>SEO stands for search engine optimization which is the task of improving the performance of the links in the search
    engine. This link can be a product listing, website or a blog post.</p>

<p>It is important because search traffic is free and organic. The search traffic will keep bringing the customers
    back, unlike the paid ads where you have to pay to get the ranking for some time.</p>

<h4>What are the types of SEO?</h4>

<p>It is of two types.</p>

<ol>
    <li>On page SEO</li>
    <li>Off page SEO</li>
</ol>

<h4>What is on page SEO?</h4>

<p>These are changes or activities that we can perform on the page or the website which would let the search engine know
    more about the page. For example: Adding header tags and adding meta tags.</p>

<h4>What is off page SEO?</h4>

<p>These are the activities that we perform off the page to improve the ranking. For example: Submitting the link on
    social media.</p>

<h4>Explain the terms: Crawling and indexing</h4>

<p>Crawling is the process in which the search engine goes to each page and start crawling for indexing them in there
    database for headers keywords and hyperlinks. Sitemaps are a good way of telling the crawler which pages to crawl.
</p>

<p>Indexing is the process of creating an index for a page which tells what the page is related to. Search engines use
    these to show the results to the users.</p>

<h4>What are SEO friendly URLs</h4>

<p>SEO friendly URLs are the URLs which are at most 1-2 levels deep. First few words of the URL are given much more
    preference to the words in the end.</p>

<h4>What are meta tags?</h4>

<p>There are many meta tags. Meta tags are to depict the behavior of a page online. Some of the main meta tags are meta
    description, meta title and meta-author. Meta title and meta description are used during the preview of the link on
    the search engine.</p>

<h4>What are backlinks?</h4>

<p>Backlinks are the links that are pointed toward your content. They play the most important role in SEO. If a lot of
    quality pages point toward your content, then search engine considers your content as important and give good search
    rankings.</p>

<p>Again, links are of two types:</p>

<h5>Do-Follow links</h5>

<p>These are the links which can be followed by the robots. If you mark a link as do-follow, while crawling the robots
    will also crawl the link. This will generate more link juice for the do-follow link.</p>

<h5>No-Follow links</h5>

<p>This is totally opposite of Do-Follow link.</p>

<h4>What is the use of robots.txt and how is it used?</h4>

<p>robots.txt is a file that is served with your website and it tells the search engine which pages to crawl and which
    pages to not crawl.</p>

<p>Here is a link to study more about it: <a href="https://webris.org/robots-txt/">Robots.txt File â€“ What Is It? How to
        Use It?</a></p>

<h4>What is sitemaps and how are they used?</h4>

<p>Sitemap are a basic files mostly XML, which tells the structure of links on a website. This way you make it easy for
    the search engine to go to each and every page of the website.</p>

<h4>What is google page rank and domain authority?</h4>

<p>Google pagerank was a score that is calculated by checking the number of quality backlinks coming to a single web
    page. Although, google is not using this number to determine ranking now.</p>

<p>Domain Authority is the count out of 100. This is considered another important factor in defining your ranking. More
    the domain authority of your page, more likely is it for your page to more traffic.</p>

<h4>What is the importance of guest posting?</h4>

<p>Guest posting is used to bring more quality backlinks and generate awareness about the products in your niche. If you
    already have a successful competitor, then you can ask them for a guest post. If they allow you, there is a
    possibility of getting some good link juice.</p>

<h4>What are the keywords?</h4>

<p>Keyword are the phrases which are used by users to search for specific thing on the search engine. It is always
    better to use long-tail keyword. These are 4+ letter words which make the search highly specific</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> SEO marketing Agency in manhattan</p>

<h4>What SEO tools are you familier with?</h4>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Google Search Console</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Google Analytics</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Google Keyword Planner</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Bing webmaster tools</strong></li>
    <li><strong>SEMRush</strong></li>
    <li><strong>MOZ</strong></li>
</ol>

<h4>What is CTR and Bounce rates?</h4>

<p>CTR stands for click through rate. It defines the rate of impressions per click on the search engine. If the people
    are click more on the link then the CTR is higher and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Bounce rate stands for the rate of peole who leave the page only after seeing a single page.</p>

<p>Ideally, the CTR should be high and bounce rate should be low.</p>
