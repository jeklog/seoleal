<h2>Long tail Keywords</h2>

<p>Search engine behavior sometimes is quite unexpected for a website owner. If you are trying to target a very
    competitive keyword and write a long post on the same topic this unexpected behavior comes in and give you search
    traffic for the keywords you were not even expecting to get. These keywords are called long-tail keywords ( Mostly
    4+ words).</p>

<p>For a search engine context of the website or page is also very important. This context is derived from the domain
    name of the website, title of the page or other related things. This context can help you to reach heights in term
    of traffic for the same related keywords. The context of the website is also helpful in increasing the <a
        href="https://seoleal.com/seo/interview/2019/05/11/seo-interview-question-answer.html">domain authority</a>. The
    same context is also responsible for increasing conversions or <a
        href="https://seoleal.com/2019/05/08/increase-CTR-by-38-percent.html">CTR</a></p>

<h2>Semantic Relevance</h2>

<p>This semantic relevance is helpful in getting the unintensional and high-quality traffic to your page. Concepts of
    Natural Language processing are used to determine this kind of semantic relevance, and Google does make use of such
    tools for indexing the web pages. This semantic or contextual relevance helps your page to rank higher in a new long
    tail keyword search made by the user on the search engine.</p>

<p>This semantic relevance is in turn dependent on domain authority. Higher the domain authority of a page, higher the
    rank.</p>

<h2>Keyword Stemming</h2>

<p>Keyword stemming is the process of adding suffixes or prefixes to the keyword and generating new relevant keywords.
    This is a process that every SEO expert should know about and every SEO campaign should use to further optimize any
    campaign to maximize the reach.</p>

<p><strong>For example</strong></p>

<p>plan can become planning</p>

<p>study can become studying or studied.</p>

<p>Most of the SEO experts tend to measure the metrics for ranking higher for a keyword for which they had targeted.
    They forget to check for the long tail keywords which are handled by the search engine automatically. This even
    allows to rank for the keywords you never had planned for. Once you rank for these keywords, you can stem more of
    such keywords and get some more traffic for those keywords.</p>

<p>You can increase the chance of ranking for these long tail keywords by writing long posts.</p>

<p>Search engines also used a time window for measuring this semantic relevance, If a page is not opened for a long time
    the relevance for the page is lost. You can use <a
        href="https://seoleal.com/seo/backlinks/2019/05/09/importance-of-inbound-link-insurance.html">internal
        linking</a>, if you want to stop that from happening.</p>

<p>Every page which passes a small threshold for the relevance starts generating traffic for the keywords that you never
    had planned for.</p>

<p>You can increase the relevance by using internal linking and backlinks for the relevant SEO websites/ other websites
    having good relevance score in a similar niche. This increases the authority for the given keywords.</p>

<p>For every few keywords you try to target for ranking well in the search engine, you will find hundereds of other
    keywords for which you will start ranking well. This will help only when the authority of the page is high in that
    given niche.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="https://seoleal.com/2019/05/05/why-is-ranking-well-important.html">value of ranking well</a> on
    the search engine.</p>

<p>SEO is a long game and should be played by picking up the low hanging fruit to start gaining some good harvest in the
    coming season. You always get what you work for. After you reach that certain level, you will start fetching the
    results for high competition keywords as well.</p>

<p>So start writing for all the topics for which your customers can search for and start getting traffic for those
    keywords. Once you get the attention of the search engines with higher CTR, they will give you traffic for the high
    competition keywords as well.</p>
